## About
I have always enjoyed HIIT workouts, but always relied on watching a clock. I decided to build an app to help automate the alerts in my workouts. 

## Technology
I decided to keep this app simple and utilize Javascript, HTML, CSS, Node.js and Heroku for deployment. Since I primarily built this app for workouts I determined that one's phone is the likely device for usage. For this reason I chose to omit a database and utilized localStorage to save one's workouts. Programmatic drawing was achieved utilizing HTML canvas element on an animation loop. The audio API was also utilized to give audible cues for the start, end of an interval, as well as the completion of the workout. Media queries were utilized to improve responsiveness across different screen widths and heights. Finally, light/dark mode was included as well.
